# PaintballBPS
A simple game that shows how fast you can fire a paintball marker.

This is basically a remake of an old game I used to play
when I was really into paintball and learning how to
shoot faster.
-It has a picture of a marker and you click the trigger
-Clicking trigger fires a paintball
-Counts each shot
-Time options (10sec, 1min, endurance)
-Tells BPS

I am making this for fun and to learn more about events and
event listeners.
